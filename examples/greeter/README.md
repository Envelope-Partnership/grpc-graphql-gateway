# Greeter example

Simple example of generating GraphQL schema out of protobuf files.

Example assumes you have distributed your plugin to dist folder (with ```make distribute``` in root folder)

You can run example directly with protoc or using make.

Run example with protoc:
```
protoc -I. -I../../include/graphql --plugin=../../dist/protoc-gen-graphql-schema --graphql-schema_out=./ greeter.proto
```

Run example with make:
```
make generate
```

Expected result is greeter.graphql file that contains the following:
```
// Code generated by protoc-gen-graphql-schema, DO NOT EDIT.

type HelloRequest {
	name: String!
}

type HelloReply {
	message: String
}

type GoodbyeRequest {
	name: String!
}

type GoodbyeReply {
	message: String!
}

type BigExample {
	str: String!
	strReq: String!
	strOpt: String
	num: Int!
	numReq: Int!
	numOpt: Int
	longLongLongName: String!
}
 
enum SecondEnum {
	C
	D
}
 
enum FirstEnum {
	A
	B
}
```
